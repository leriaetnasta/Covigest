Covid-19 management system in c (hospitals/hotels)
The following is a console application using C language. In this console application, you can add patients, hospitals, suspected patients and hotels, view, search and edit. 
The app can suggest a hospital based on the state of the patient as well as their adresse and hotels to suspected patients in the same manner. The user cannot delete a hospital unless they don't have a patients that are confirmed covid-19 and if a patient dies or gets released they get automatically deleted.
